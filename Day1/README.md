Hey !! Let's get you started shall we?
Today, I will be explaining how you can contribute to this repo.
I know it's kinda looks hard the first time , but we are always looking forward to the challenge, that makes us hackers.
Now back to contributing to this repo or any other repository.
I'm going to list a couple of important steps you'd have to take. Note : git is more extensive , we are only picking the important part to get you started .
## First :
    Register and Login into your GitHub account (that should be easy) . 
    The next thing we have to do is fork this repository . Forking in this case is making a copy of the repository to your personal repository.
    After this you should see the "300-days-of-hacking" on your list of repositories. 
    Now, you can make any changes you want to this repo ( it's yours now anyway)
    The changes in this case should be constructive (I hope). That's adding the description of the vulnerability you will be teaching us and the resources according to the structure specified in the home readme.
    After you are satisfied with these changes on your own personal copy of the repo , now you can send the changes to us to add to our own version (original copy of 300-days-of-hacking) by opening a pull request .
    That's it, if you've made it this far... congratulations!!!.  If your changes are accepted by cHowTV , your push request will be merged . then you are now an official contributor to 300-days-of-hacking!!
